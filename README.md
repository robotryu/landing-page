# INSTRUCTIONS
1. The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.
2. Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

## TIPS
1. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.

2. For the section you’re working on do the HTML and then do the CSS.

3. Many of the elements on this page are very similar to things you saw in our flexbox exercises… feel free to go back to those if you need a refresher.

4. Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device. We’ll learn that later.

### Viewing your project on the web
Make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you need to rename it.

Go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the Settings button as shown in the screenshot below.Screenshot pointing to the Settings located in an example repository

Click on Pages on the left side bar.

Change the Source from none to main branch and click Save.

It may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10), but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link).
